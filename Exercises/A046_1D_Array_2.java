/*
Let's play a game on an array! You're standing at index 0 of an "n"-element array named "game". 
From some index "i", you can perform one of the following moves:
- Move Backward: If cell "i-1" exists and contains a 0, you can walk back to cell "i-1".
- Move Forward:
    - If cell "i+1" contains a zero, you can walk to cell "i+1".
    - If cell "i+leap" contains a zero, you can jump to cell "i+leap".
    - If you're standing in cell "n-1" or the value of "i+leap >= n", you can walk or jump off the end of the array and win the game.
In other words, you can move from index  to index "i+1", "i-1", or "i+leap" as long as the destination index is a cell containing a 0. 
If the destination index is greater than "n+1", you win the game.

Function Description
Complete the canWin function in the editor below. canWin has the following parameters:
    int leap: the size of the leap
    int game[n]: the array to traverse

Returns: boolean: true if the game can be won, otherwise false

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, "q", denoting the number of queries (i.e., function calls).
The "2*q" subsequent lines describe each query over two lines:
    The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of "n" and "leap".
    The second line contains "n" space-separated binary integers (i.e., zeroes and ones) describing the respective values of game0, game1,...gamen.

Explanation

We perform the following q=4 queries:
- For game=[0,0,0,0,0] and "leap = 3", we can walk and/or jump to the end of the array because every cell contains a 0. Because we can win, we return true.
- For game=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] and leap=5, we can walk to index  and then jump  units to the end of the array. Because we can win, we return true.
For  and , there is no way for us to get past the three consecutive ones. Because we cannot win, we return false.
For  and , there is no way for us to get past the one at index . Because we cannot win, we return false.
